# Template Repo

Consider adding a [repostatus](https://www.repostatus.org/) tag here

## Usage

- Create new repo without any default files and clone it to local system.
- Copy all files from this project to the new one.  Remeber to copy files that beging with `.`.
- Add just the `.gitignore` for first commit and commit it to repo.  This is because modifying the very first commit (called the root commit) is pretty much impossible so the first commit should have very little in it.
- Choose one of the `LICENSE.(description)` files and rename it to `LICENSE`.  Remove all others.
- Update this readme file.
